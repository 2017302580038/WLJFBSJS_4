## P20

We can periodically take a snapshot of the DNS caches in the local DNS servers. The Web server that appears most frequently in the DNS caches is the most popular server. This is because if more users are interested in a Web server, then DNS requests for that server are more frequently sent by users. Thus, that Web server will appear in the DNS caches more frequently.

## P22

Minimal time to distribute *F* to *N* clients using client-server approach:

*D<sub>c-s</sub> = max {NF/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>}*

Minimal time to distribute *F* to *N* clients using P2P approach:

*D<sub>P2P</sub> = max {F/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>, NF/(u<sub>s</sub> + &Sigma;u<sub>i</sub>)}*

Where

*F* = 15Gb = 15 * 1024 Mb

*u<sub>s</sub>* = 30 Mbps

*d<sub>min</sub>* = *d<sub>i</sub>* = 2 Mbps

*F / u<sub>s</sub>* = 512 sec

*F / d<sub>min</sub>* = 7680 sec

## P30

Yes, you can configure many browsers to open multiple simultaneous  onnections to a Web site. The advantage is that you will you potentially download the file faster. The disadvantage is that you may be hogging the bandwidth, thereby significantly slowing down the downloads of other users who are sharing the same physical links.
