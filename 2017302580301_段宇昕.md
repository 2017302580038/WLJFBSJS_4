## P22  
The minimum distribution time for client-server  
> D(cs) = max{NF/u(server), F/d(min)}  

The minimum distribution time for P2P    
> D(p2p) = max{F/u(server), F/d(min), NF/(u(server)+sum of u(i))} 
 
For these parameters, F = 15Gb, u(server) = 30Mbps, d(min) = d(i) = 2Mbps   
**CS**  
| u       | N=10  | N=100 | N=1000 |
| :------ | :---: | :---: | :----: |
| 300Kbps | 7680  | 51200 | 512000 |
| 700Kbps | 7680  | 51200 | 512000 |
| 2Mbps   | 7680  | 51200 | 512000 |

**P2P**
| u       | N=10  | N=100 | N=1000 |
| :------ | :---: | :---: | :----: |
| 300Kbps | 7680  | 25904 | 47559  |
| 700Kbps | 7680  | 15616 | 21525  |
| 2Mbps   | 7680  | 7680  |  7680  |

## P23  
### a  
Because u(server)/N <= d(min), we can guarantee that the server distributes the file simultaneously to N clients using equal uploading speed--u(server)/N, while every client can download with a downloading speed no greater than d(min).   
Thus the total time is F / (u(server)/N) = NF/u(server).  
### b
Because u(server)/N >= d(min), we can let the server distributes the file with speed d(min) simultaneously to N clients. In this case, every client will download the file with speed d(min).
Thus the total time is F/d(min).  
### c  
Based on previous two question a and b, we consider two circumstances.   
1. First is u(server)/N <= d(min).  
   From question a, we get that there is a distribution time of equation NF/u(server).  
2. Second is u(server)/N >= d(min).  
   From question b, we get that there is a distribution time of equation F/d(min).  

Besides, D >= max{NF/u(server), F/d(min)}. In case (1), D = NF/u(server). In case (2), D = F/d(min).  
Thus, D = max{NF/u(server), F/d(min)}.  
## P26  
### a  
It's true. If there is always enough peers staying in the network and sharing this file, Bob can receive all the chunks of file.  
### b  
It's true. Bob can run a client on each host and just like (a), each client can receive a part of chunks. Then put these chunks together, he can get the whole file.
