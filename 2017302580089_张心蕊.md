### P7

total time to get IP address:
			$RTT_{1}+ RTT_{2}+ ...+RTT_{n}.$
And the total response time:

​			$2RTT_{0}+RTT_{1}+RTT_{2}+...+RTT_{n}$

### P27

a. N files.
b. 2N files

### P28

a) If TCPClient is run first, the client will try to connect to a server process that does not exist with TCP. No TCP connection will be made.

b) UDPClient does not establish a TCP connection with the server. So everything should work fine if you run udpClient for the first time, then run udpServer, then type some input keyboard.

c) If a different port number is used, the client will try to establish a TCP connection error process or a non-existent process. An error will occur.
