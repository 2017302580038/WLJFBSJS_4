**P23**

a.

  Distribution scheme: The server sends the file to each client in parallel (sending rate: u_s/N).

  Since the server's upload(sending to clients) rate is less than the client download rate ( u_s/N <= d_min)
  
  The client's receive rate is u_s/N.
  
  The time for each client to receive the whole file: F/(u_s/N)= NF / u_s
  
  The overall distribution time is NF / u_s
  
b.

  Distribution scheme: The server sends the file to each client in parallel (sending rate: d_min).

  Since the aggregate rate Nd_min is less than the server's link rate u_s (Nd_min <= u_s)
  
  
  The time for each client to receive the whole file: F/d_min
  
  The overall distribution time is F/d_min
 
 c.
 
  D_cs= NF/u_s when u_s/N<=d_min
  
  D_cs=F/d_min when u_s/N>=d_min
 
  The minimum distribution time is in general given by max{NF/u_s, F/d_min}

**P28**

a.

  The TCP connection will not be made, because the client the server process doesn't exist.
  
b.

  It will work fine, because UDPClient doesn't need to establish a TCP connection with the server.
 
 c.
 
  There will be errors, because the client will attempt to establish a TCP connection with a wrong process or a process which doesn't exist.

**P30**

  Yes.
  
  Advantage: You may download files from this website faster.
  
  Disadvantage: You may slow down the downloads of other users who are sharing the same physical links since you are hogging the bandwidth.
